# - Config file for ignition-cmake (not for any other ignition libraries).

# To find and load ignition-cmake modules into your project, simply invoke:
#
# find_package(@PKG_NAME@)
#
# That will define the variable @PKG_NAME@_FOUND, and will open up access
# to all the cmake-modules and find-modules that are provided by ignition-cmake.

# We explicitly set the desired cmake version to ensure that the policy settings
# of users or of toolchains do not result in the wrong behavior for our modules.
# Note that the call to find_package(~) will PUSH a new policy stack before
# taking on these version settings, and then that stack will POP after the
# find_package(~) has exited, so this will not affect the cmake policy settings
# of a caller.

#  1. ign-cmake has not been included yet, or
#  2. we need a higher version of ign-cmake than the last one that was included
#
# The only time we should need to switch to a higher version of ign-cmake is
# when importing targets for dependencies, i.e. using the find-modules of
# ign-cmake. All find-modules that are available in older versions of ign-cmake
# should be available in newer versions of ign-cmake, so this should not create
# any conflicts.
