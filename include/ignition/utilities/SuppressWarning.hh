// This header contains cross-platform macros for suppressing warnings. Please
// only use these macros responsibly when you are certain that the compiler is
// producing a warning that is not applicable to the specific instance. Do not
// use these macros to ignore legitimate warnings, even if you may find them
// irritating.

/*
 * Usage example:
 *
 * SomeClass *ptr = CreatePtr();
 * IGN_UTILS_WARN_IGNORE__NON_VIRTUAL_DESTRUCTOR
 * delete ptr;
 * IGN_UTILS_WARN_RESUME__NON_VIRTUAL_DESTRUCTOR

/// \brief Compilers might warn about deleting a pointer to a class that has
/// virtual functions without a virtual destructor or a `final` declaration,
/// because the pointer might secretly be pointing to a more derived class type.
/// We want to suppress this warning when we know for certain (via the design
/// of our implementation) that the pointer is definitely not pointing to a more
/// derived type.

/// \brief Microsoft Visual Studio does not automatically export the interface
/// information for member variables that belong to interface classes of a DLL.
/// Instead it issues this warning. When the member variable is private, we
/// choose to suppress the warning instead of needlessly adding the class
/// information to the DLL interface.

// TODO(anyone): Add more warning types as they become relevant.
