    /// \brief The ImplPtr class provides a convenient away to achieve the
    /// <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three">
    /// Rule of Zero</a> while keeping all the benefits of PIMPL. This saves us
    /// from writing an enormous amount of boilerplate code for each class.
    ///
    /// To follow PIMPL design principles, create an object of this type as the
    /// one and only member variable of your class, e.g.:
    ///
    /// \code
    /// class MyClass
    /// {
    ///   public: /* ... public member functions ... */
    ///
    ///   private: class Implementation;
    ///   private: ImplPtr<Implementation> dataPtr;
    /// };
    /// \endcode
    ///
    /// When constructing the \code{dataPtr} object, pass it
    /// \code{MakeImpl<Implementation>(/* ... args ... */)} in the
    /// initialization list of your class. \sa MakeImpl<T>()
    ///
    /// This class was inspired by the following blog post:
    /// http://oliora.github.io/2015/12/29/pimpl-and-rule-of-zero.html
    ///
    /// For interface classes that should not be copiable, see the UniqueImplPtr
    /// class further down in this header.
    ///
    /// \note Switching between ImplPtr and UniqueImplPtr is \em NOT ABI-safe.
    /// This is essentially the same as changing whether or not the class
    /// provides a copy-constructor and a copy-assignment operator, which is
    /// bound to result in runtime linking issues at a minimum (but more
    /// importantly, it changes the binary footprint of the class). If it is not
    /// obvious whether a class should be copiable, then the safest choice is to
    /// use a UniqueImplPtr and then manually add the copy constructor/operator
    /// later if it is deemed acceptable. The next time an ABI update is
    /// permitted, those manually written functions can be removed and the
    /// UniqueImplPtr can be replaced with an ImplPtr.
