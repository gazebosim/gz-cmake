# - Try to find ZeroMQ headers and libraries
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(ZeroMQ)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  ZeroMQ_ROOT_DIR  Set this variable to the root installation of
#                            ZeroMQ if the module has problems finding
#                            the proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  ZEROMQ_FOUND              System has ZeroMQ libs/headers
#  ZeroMQ_LIBRARIES          The ZeroMQ libraries
#  ZeroMQ_INCLUDE_DIRS       The location of ZeroMQ headers

include(IgnPkgConfig)

# We initialize this variable to the default target name
set(ZeroMQ_TARGET ZeroMQ::ZeroMQ)

find_package(ZeroMQ ${ZeroMQ_FIND_VERSION} QUIET CONFIG)
if (ZeroMQ_FOUND)

  # ZeroMQ's cmake script imports its own target, so we'll
  # overwrite the default with the name of theirs. In the
  # future, we should be able to use a target alias instead.
  set(ZeroMQ_TARGET libzmq)

  # Make sure to fill out the pkg-config information before quitting
  ign_pkg_config_entry(ZeroMQ "libzmq >= ${ZeroMQ_FIND_VERSION}")

  return()
