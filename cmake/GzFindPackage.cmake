#
# This is a wrapper for the standard cmake find_package which behaves according
# to the conventions of the Gazebo library. In particular, we do not quit
# immediately when a required package is missing. Instead, we check all
# dependencies and provide an overview of what is missing at the end of the
# configuration process. Descriptions of the function arguments are as follows:
#
# <PACKAGE_NAME>: The name of the package as it would normally be passed to
#                 find_package(~). Note if your package corresponds to a
#                 find-module named FindABC.cmake, then <PACKAGE_NAME> must be
#                 ABC, with the case matching. If the find-module is named
#                 FindAbc.cmake, then <PACKAGE_NAME> must be Abc. This will not
#                 necessarily match the library's actual name, nor will it
#                 necessarily match the name used by pkgconfig, so there are
#                 additional arguments (i.e. PRETTY, PKGCONFIG) to specify
#                 alternative names for this package that can be used depending
#                 on the context.
#
# [REQUIRED]: Optional. If provided, macro will trigger a Gazebo build_error
#             when the package cannot be found. If not provided, this macro will
#             trigger a Gazebo build_warning when the package is not found.
#             To specify that something is required by some set of components
#             (rather than the core library), use REQUIRED_BY.
#
# [PRIVATE]: Optional. Use this to indicate that consumers of the project do not
#            need to link against the package, but it must be present on the
#            system, because our project must link against it.
#
# [EXACT]: Optional. This will pass on the EXACT option to find_package(~) and
#          also add it to the call to find_dependency(~) in the
#          <project>-config.cmake file.
#
# [QUIET]: Optional. If provided, it will be passed forward to cmake's
#          find_package(~) command. This macro will still print its normal
#          output, except there will be no warning if the package is missing,
#          unless REQUIRED or REQUIRED_BY is specified.
#
# [CONFIG]: Optional. If provided, it will be passed forward to cmake's
#          find_package(~) command. This will trigger Config mode search rather than
#          Module mode.
#
# [BUILD_ONLY]: Optional. Use this to indicate that the project only needs this
#               package while building, and it does not need to be available to
#               the consumer of this project at all. Normally this should only
#               apply to (1) a header-only library whose headers are included
#               exclusively in the source files and not included in any public
#               (i.e. installed) project headers, or to (2) a static library
#               dependency.
#
# [PKGCONFIG_IGNORE]: Discouraged. If this option is provided, this package will
#                     not be added to the project's pkgconfig file in any way.
#                     This should only be used in very rare circumstances. Note
#                     that BUILD_ONLY will also prevent a pkgconfig entry from
#                     being produced.
#
# [COMPONENTS]: Optional. If provided, the list that follows it will be passed
#               to find_package(~) to indicate which components of PACKAGE_NAME
#               are considered to be dependencies of either this project
#               (specified by REQUIRED) or this project's components (specified
#               by REQUIRED_BY). This is effectively the same as the
#               find_package( ... COMPONENTS <components>) argument.
#
# [REQUIRED_BY]: Optional. If provided, the list that follows it must indicate
#                which library components require the dependency. Note that if
#                REQUIRED is specified, then REQUIRED_BY does NOT need to be
#                specified for any components which depend on the core library,
#                because their dependence on this package will effectively be
#                inherited from the core library. This will trigger a build
#                warning to tell the user which component requires this
#                dependency.
#
# [PRIVATE_FOR]: Optional. If provided, the list that follows it must indicate
#                which library components depend on this package privately (i.e.
#                the package should not be included in its list of interface
#                libraries). This is only relevant for components that follow
#                the REQUIRED_BY command. Note that the PRIVATE argument does
#                not apply to components specified by REQUIRED_BY. This argument
#                MUST be given for components whose private dependencies have
#                been specified with REQUIRED_BY.
#
# [VERSION]: Optional. Follow this argument with the major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]
#            version that you need for this package.
#
# [EXTRA_ARGS]: Optional. Additional args to pass forward to find_package(~)
#
# [PRETTY]: Optional. If provided, the string that follows will replace
#           <PACKAGE_NAME> when printing messages, warnings, or errors to the
#           terminal.
#
# [PURPOSE]: Optional. If provided, the string that follows will be appended to
#            the build_warning or build_error that this function produces when
#            the package could not be found.
#
#  ==========================================================================
#  The following arguments pertain to the automatic generation of your
#  project's pkgconfig file. Ideally, this information should be provided
#  automatically by gz-cmake through the cmake find-module that is written
#  for your dependency. However, if your package gets distributed with its own
#  cmake config-file or find-module, then it might not automatically set this
#  information. Therefore, we provide the ability to set it through your call to
#  gz_find_package(~). These arguments can also be used to overwrite the
#  pkg-config entries that get generated by the gz-cmake find-module for the
#  package. Do not hesitate to ask for help if you need to use these arguments.
#
# [PKGCONFIG]: Optional. If provided, the string that follows will be used to
#              specify a "required package" for pkgconfig. Note that the option
#              PKGCONFIG_LIB has higher precedence than this option.
#
# [PKGCONFIG_LIB]: Optional. Use this to indicate that the package should be
#                  considered a "library" by pkgconfig. This is used for
#                  libraries which do not come with *.pc metadata, such as
#                  system libraries, libm, libdl, or librt. Generally you should
#                  leave this out, because most packages will be considered
#                  "modules" by pkgconfig. The string which follows this
#                  argument will be used as the library name, and the string
#                  that follows a PKGCONFIG argument will be ignored, so the
#                  PKGCONFIG argument can be left out when using this argument.
#
# [PKGCONFIG_VER_COMPARISON]: Optional. If provided, pkgconfig will be told how
#                             the available version of this package must compare
#                             to the specified version. Acceptable values are
#                             =, <, >, <=, >=. Default will be =. If no version
#                             is provided using VERSION, then this will be left
#                             out, whether or not it is provided.
