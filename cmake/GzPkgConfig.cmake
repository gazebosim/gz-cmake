########################################
# An alternative to pkg_check_modules that creates an "imported target" which
# helps us to make relocatable packages.
#
# NOTE: This macro assumes that pkg-config is the only means by which you will
#       be searching for the package. If you intend to continue searching in the
#       event that pkg-config fails (or is unavailable), then you should instead
#       call gz_pkg_check_modules_quiet(~).
#
# NOTE: If you need to specify a version comparison for pkg-config, then your
#       second argument must be wrapped in quotes. E.g. if you want to find
#       version greater than or equal to 3.2.1 of a package called SomePackage
#       which is known to pkg-config as libsomepackage, then you should call
#       gz_pkg_check_modules as follows:
#
#       gz_pkg_check_modules(SomePackage "libsomepackage >= 3.2.1")
#
#       The quotes and spaces in the second argument are all very important in
#       order to ensure that our auto-generated *.pc file gets filled in
#       correctly. If you do not have any version requirements, then you can
#       simply leave all of that out:
#
#       gz_pkg_check_modules(SomePackage libsomepackage)
#
#       Without the version comparison, the quotes and spacing are irrelevant.
#       This usage note applies to gz_pkg_check_modules_quiet(~) as well.
